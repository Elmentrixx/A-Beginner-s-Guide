#### 1. **Create an Account**

   - Visit [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and sign up for an account. You can use your email, GitHub, or social media accounts.
   - Having an account allows you to track your progress, save solutions, and participate in discussions.

#### 2. **Explore the Problem Set**
   - After logging in, click on the "Problems" tab.
   - LeetCode organizes problems by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. For beginners, it’s recommended to start with **Easy** problems.
   - Problems are also grouped by topic (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming) and company (e.g., Google, Amazon) for focused practice.

#### 3. **Select a Problem**
   - Choose a problem you want to solve. You’ll be presented with a description of the problem, input/output requirements, and sample test cases.
   - You can see how many people have solved the problem and its acceptance rate (the percentage of people who solved it correctly).

#### 4. **Use the Online Code Editor**
   - LeetCode provides an integrated online editor with support for multiple programming languages (Python, C++, Java, etc.). You can select your preferred language from a dropdown menu.
   - Write your code in the editor and use the **Run** button to test your solution against the sample cases.
   - If your code passes the sample test cases, you can submit it to be evaluated against hidden test cases by clicking **Submit**.
